# Text-Extraction-From-Image
 Generation Text from image using Optical Character Recognition

In this project, we are extracting text from images by using Tesseract OCR (python module: pytesseract). After extracting the text we will apply some basic functions of OpenCV on that text to enhance it and to get more accurate results. This project will be very useful as it will save time and effort of typing from an image.
